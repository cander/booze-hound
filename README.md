Welcome to this work in progress. The plan here is to create a tool to
enhance and improve the search page for the 
[Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission - OLCC](http://www.oregonliquorsearch.com).
If/when I get this to a usable state, I'll document it. Right now, it's more
of an experiment using Ruby on Rails.
